JavaScript implementation of the timer APIs; `setTimeout`, `clearTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `clearImmediate`, `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `cancelAnimationFrame`, `requestIdleCallback`, and `cancelIdleCallback`, along with a clock instance that controls the flow of time. FakeTimers also provides a `Date` implementation that gets its time from the clock.

In addition in browser environment `@sinonjs/fake-timers` provides a `performance` implementation that gets its time from the clock. In Node environments FakeTimers provides a `nextTick` implementation that is synchronized with the clock - and a `process.hrtime` shim that works with the clock.

`@sinonjs/fake-timers` can be used to simulate passing time in automated tests and other
situations where you want the scheduling semantics, but don't want to actually
wait.

`@sinonjs/fake-timers` is extracted from [Sinon.JS](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon.js) and targets the [same runtimes](https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/#supported-runtimes).

## Autocomplete, IntelliSense and TypeScript definitions

Version 7 introduced JSDoc to the codebase. This should provide autocomplete and type suggestions in supporting IDEs. If you need more elaborate type support, TypeScript definitions for the Sinon projects are independently maintained by the Definitely Types community:

```
npm install -D @types/sinonjs__fake-timers
```

## Installation

`@sinonjs/fake-timers` can be used in both Node and browser environments. Installation is as easy as

```sh
npm install @sinonjs/fake-timers
```

If you want to use `@sinonjs/fake-timers` in a browser you can either build your own bundle or use [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev).

## Usage

To use `@sinonjs/fake-timers`, create a new clock, schedule events on it using the timer
functions and pass time using the `tick` method.

```js
// In the browser distribution, a global `FakeTimers` is already available
var FakeTimers = require("@sinonjs/fake-timers");
var clock = FakeTimers.createClock();

clock.setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(
        "The poblano is a mild chili pepper originating in the state of Puebla, Mexico."
    );
}, 15);

// ...

clock.tick(15);
```

Upon executing the last line, an interesting fact about the
[Poblano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poblano) will be printed synchronously to
the screen. If you want to simulate asynchronous behavior, you have to use your
imagination when calling the various functions.

The `next`, `runAll`, `runToFrame`, and `runToLast` methods are available to advance the clock. See the
API Reference for more details.

### Faking the native timers

When using `@sinonjs/fake-timers` to test timers, you will most likely want to replace the native
timers such that calling `setTimeout` actually schedules a callback with your
clock instance, not the browser's internals.

Calling `install` with no arguments achieves this. You can call `uninstall`
later to restore things as they were again.

```js
// In the browser distribution, a global `FakeTimers` is already available
var FakeTimers = require("@sinonjs/fake-timers");

var clock = FakeTimers.install();
// Equivalent to
// var clock = FakeTimers.install(typeof global !== "undefined" ? global : window);

setTimeout(fn, 15); // Schedules with clock.setTimeout

clock.uninstall();
// setTimeout is restored to the native implementation
```

To hijack timers in another context pass it to the `install` method.

```js
var FakeTimers = require("@sinonjs/fake-timers");
var context = {
    setTimeout: setTimeout, // By default context.setTimeout uses the global setTimeout
};
var clock = FakeTimers.withGlobal(context).install();

context.setTimeout(fn, 15); // Schedules with clock.setTimeout

clock.uninstall();
// context.setTimeout is restored to the original implementation
```

Usually you want to install the timers onto the global object, so call `install`
without arguments.

#### Automatically incrementing mocked time

FakeTimers supports the possibility to attach the faked timers to any change
in the real system time. This means that there is no need to `tick()` the
clock in a situation where you won't know **when** to call `tick()`.

Please note that this is achieved using the original setImmediate() API at a certain
configurable interval `config.advanceTimeDelta` (default: 20ms). Meaning time would
be incremented every 20ms, not in real time.

An example would be:

```js
var FakeTimers = require("@sinonjs/fake-timers");
var clock = FakeTimers.install({
    shouldAdvanceTime: true,
    advanceTimeDelta: 40,
});

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("this just timed out"); //executed after 40ms
}, 30);

setImmediate(() => {
    console.log("not so immediate"); //executed after 40ms
});

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("this timed out after"); //executed after 80ms
    clock.uninstall();
}, 50);
```

## API Reference

### `var clock = FakeTimers.createClock([now[, loopLimit]])`

Creates a clock. The default
[epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_%28reference_date%29) is `0`.

The `now` argument may be a number (in milliseconds) or a Date object.

The `loopLimit` argument sets the maximum number of timers that will be run when calling `runAll()` before assuming that we have an infinite loop and throwing an error. The default is `1000`.

### `var clock = FakeTimers.install([config])`

Installs FakeTimers using the specified config (otherwise with epoch `0` on the global scope). The following configuration options are available

| Parameter                        | Type        | Default                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
